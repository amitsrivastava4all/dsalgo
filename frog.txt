Shaggy has a frog Akki. Akki is very hungry and Shaggy decides to feed it by playing a little game. Akki is a special frog which can jump as far as it wants but has a special pattern: He starts at the point 0.
In his first turn, he can make a jump of 1 unit. Now for all consequent turns, if the frog is currently at a distance x (from the start), his jump will take him x units forward. Given a leaf at a distance N , you have to find if the frog can reach that leaf or not.
Input
* The first line contains number of test cases 'T' followed by 'T' non-negative integer 'x' denoting the distance.
Output:
* Output contains T line containing,for each test cases True if the frog Akki can reach that pillar and print False otherwise.


Example:
Input:
3 1 7 64
Output:
True False True
